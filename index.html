                <br>
                Our themes are artificial intelligence, blockchain / web3, and financial technology.

                <br><br>
                That's great! We will have workshops from March 18 through March 21, as well as lots of online and onsite mentors to help you design, develop, and demo real-world solutions involving artificial intelligence, blockchain / web3, and financial technology.
                <br>
                Our sponsors will also provide resources to help you navigate various technologies.
                <br>
                If you need anything else, we recommend searching online, especially Stack Overflow.
                <br><br>
                <b>What do I need to build?</b>
                <br><br>
                We welcome all software and hardware hacks that align with our three themes: artificial intelligence, blockchain / web3, and financial technology.
                <br>
                On March 24 (Sunday), at both host campuses, we will award prizes to the top two teams in each of our three themes.
                <br>
                On April 7 (Sunday), we will award online international prizes to our online winners, including the top teams in each of our three themes.

                <br><br>
                Yes! We will award prizes to the top two teams in each of our three themes: artificial intelligence, blockchain / web3, and financial technology. You can also check our Devpost’s prizes section for more updates on how you can win sponsor prizes.
                <br>
                We will also offer prizes for a cross-campus scavenger hunt!
                <br><br>
                <b>How much does it cost to attend LIVE AI?</b>
                <br><br>
                LIVE AI is completely free to attend!
                <br><br>
                <b>Can I work with others?</b>
                <br><br>
                Yes, we encourage everyone to work in teams with an upper limit of 4 people. There’s always a lot you can learn from each other, and this is a great chance to continue building existing friendships and find new friends, maybe even a new best friend!
                <br>
                On March 22, we will have Friday night mixers at both host campuses so everyone can meet each other. After Opening Ceremonies on March 23, we will have team-building exercises to continue helping people find new teammates.
                <br>
                Of course, our <a href="https://discord.gg/KYKMQfbzAF">Discord</a> also has channels where you can start looking for teammates!
                <br><br>
                <b>How can I support LIVE AI?</b>
                <br><br>
                You may register to serve as a mentor (onsite or online) and apply to serve as a judge (onsite or online).
